These resources are created for RPG Maker MV by Kadokawa. You need to own a legal licence for this particular RPG Maker.
You are only allowed to use these ressurces in your RPG Maker projects. The resources are build upon the original Run Time Package (RTP) - therefore they are "edits" and all creative rights belong to Enterbrain/Kadokawa.

- Resources are free to use (commercial too), but you must credit PandaMaru.
- You are free to alter the resources for your own purpose.
- If you alter or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- Please don't repost resources, link back to this thread or my homepage.

Due to the amount of resources I can only update from time to time. My complete stuff can be found here: https://rpgmaker-mv.de/forum/thread/17-maru-s-mv-ressourcen/
